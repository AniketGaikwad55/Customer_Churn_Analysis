# Customer Churn Analysis using Pandas

## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn data using Python and the **Pandas** library. The objective is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition, enabling businesses to take proactive steps to reduce churn.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the distribution of churned vs. active customers  
- Identify key demographic and service-related factors affecting churn  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Pandas  
- Prepare the dataset for further predictive modeling or visualization  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (optional) – For visualization support  

## 📁 Dataset Overview

Typical fields in the dataset include:

- Customer ID  
- Gender  
- Senior Citizen  
- Tenure  
- Monthly Charges  
- Total Charges  
- Contract Type  
- Internet Service  
- Payment Method  
- Churn (Yes/No)  

(*Note: A sample or open-source dataset such as the Telco Customer Churn dataset was used.*)

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:**  
   - Handled missing and inconsistent data  
   - Converted data types where necessary  
   - Removed duplicates if found

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed churn rate distribution  
   - Explored correlations between features and churn  
   - Aggregated statistics by customer segments  

3. **Insights Identified:**  
   - Higher churn observed in customers with month-to-month contracts  
   - Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn  
   - Senior citizens showed slightly higher churn rates  

## 📌 Conclusion

The analysis using Pandas provided valuable insights into the behavior and attributes of churned customers. These findings can be used to guide retention strategies and prepare data for machine learning models.
